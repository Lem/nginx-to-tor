For setting up a backend you need
to do following:

- Edit torrc for running a hidden
  service:
  HiddenServiceDir /etc/tor/hidden_service/
  HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:44

  With the lines obove, a hiddenservice on 
  port 80 will connect to your local
  port 44. Now you can run an httpd
  listening on port 44.

- Grab your .onion from 
  HiddenServiceDir/hostname and 
  put it into the nginx.conf of
  your frontend (proxy_pass).

- Configurate your webserver
  and/or scipts to use the
  adresse of your frontend.

- Start tor and httpd
