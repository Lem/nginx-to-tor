For setting up a frontend you need to 
do the following steps:

- Download and patch version 0.8.54 of nginx
	http://nginx.org/
- Download/compile latest torsocks 
	http://code.google.com/p/torsocks/
- Fire up Privoxy. 
  Note that the options accept-intercepted-requests 
  and forward-socks4a are important. If 
  accept-intercepted-requests is not set to 1, 
  nginx will not get through privoxy.
  You can use config.privoxy.
- Edit your nginx.conf:
  location / {
           proxy_pass http://your.onion;
  }
- Start nginx with tordns:
  ~$ usewithtor /path/to/nginx
