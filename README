How it works:


  user -> nginx -> privoxy -> tor ----internet
                                          |
                                          |
                                          |
                         httpd <- tor <----
         
 nginx will use privoxy as http-proxy which
 will be tunneled through the onion-network,
 so the backend will be hidden completely.
 Oh, and the frontend can use a TLD.
 That's great, your hidden httpd will be
 available for everyone :).
